        <h2>When was the last time you made someone's day?</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of ProtoHack, a codefree hackathon, each team gave they're pitches for what they wanted to build. My friend Sarah posed the above prompt in her initial pitch for the idea of GivJoy during this pitch. This question really resonated with me and I decided to join their team and help them solve their problem.</p>

        <h2>What we made— GivJoy</h2>
        <p>Givjoy is a web and mobile application for allowing a person to bring joy to their friends. GivJoy does this by creating a marketplace wherein a joy-sender can employ a person with a joy-giving, creative talents to bring joy to their friends. GivJoy was created at ProtoHack, a code-free hackathon, in 9 hours.</p>
        <p>Our ProtoHack team consisted of 5 individuals–3 Buisiness Development experts and 1 other UX Designer besides myself. I was by far the most junior person in the team–Most of the others had been in their respective industries for 5+ years. I wanted to pull my own weight in the team and prove myself.</p>
